    <h3>Will</h3>
    <p>I am majoring in software of engineering. I began to learn about computers in seventh grade and started building and selling them in highschool. I love hardware but I feel that the software side of this field is open to more oportunity in terms of an occupation.</p>
    <p>I am currently selling solar panels part time. Door to door sales is something I've been doing since I was 17 before I left for my mission to Argentina, so I am excited to begin working again.</p>
    <p>I love that here at BYUI the school is focused on Christ and the importance of educational progression. The Lord has stated in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 130, versus 18-19 "Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.
        And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come."</p>
